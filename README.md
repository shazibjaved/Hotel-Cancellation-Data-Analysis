# Hotel-Cancellation-Data-Analysis  
# Overview
In recent years, both city and resort hotels have experienced high cancellation rates, leading to significant issues such as reduced revenues and inefficient use of hotel rooms. This project aims to address these challenges by providing actionable business insights to help hotels lower their cancellation rates and improve their revenue generation efficiency.  
# Business Problem
City and resort hotels have been facing increased cancellation rates, which have resulted in:  


* Fewer revenues: Cancellations lead to lost potential income.
* Less efficient room utilization: Vacant rooms represent missed opportunities.
The primary goal is to reduce the cancellation rates for both types of hotels. This will improve operational efficiency and increase revenue generation. The project provides business advice and insights to address these issues effectively.
# Project Approach
